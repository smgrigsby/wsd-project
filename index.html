			<p>As a Nanny, I love how easy it is to make comments or upload pictures. I can make a note about how long the children slept or pass on a funny story without disturbing their parents at work. <span class="name">-Carol Ann Meridian, MS</span></p>

			<p>It is hard trusting someone to take care of your children. NannyNotes has given me peace of mind. I know my children are in good hands and are having fun. <span class="name">-Paul Ithica, NY</span></p>
