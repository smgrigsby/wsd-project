<h3>Here are a few comments from our Nanny Notes members:</h3>

<p>NannyNotes is great! I can check in on my two boys without interrupting their day. I really love the new photo albums! It makes it easy to save and print my favorites. -Jill Gig Harbor, WA</p>

<p>As a Nanny, I love how easy it is to make comments or upload pictures. I can make a note about how long the children slept or pass on a funny story without disturbing their parents at work. -Carol Ann Meridian,MS</p

<p>It is hard trusting someone to take care of your children. NannyNotes has given me peace of mind. I know my children are in good hands and are having fun. </p>
